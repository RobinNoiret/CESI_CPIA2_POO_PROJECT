## Diagrams

###  1. Use case diagram

Using a use case diagram is essential to ensure a clear understanding of our project and system. It provides a visual representation of the system's features from the perspective of its users, identifying actors and interactions. It abstracts features by highlighting the main interactions between actors and the system, thus simplifying complexity.

As a communication tool, it facilitates understanding of major features and expected interactions among stakeholders and development team members. These diagrams establish a solid foundation for development by defining functional requirements and guiding the design and implementation processes.

Emphasizing concrete usage scenarios, they assist in anticipating user needs while remaining adaptable to evolutions and changes throughout the development cycle.

### 2. Class diagram
Utilizing a class diagram is crucial for ensuring a clear understanding of our project and system. It provides a visual representation of the static structure of the system, identifying classes, relationships between classes, attributes, and methods. It abstracts the system's features by grouping similar concepts into classes, simplifying the overall system complexity.

As a communication tool, class diagrams facilitate effective communication among team members by offering a shared view of the system. This aids in comprehending different aspects of the structure and serves as a reference for maintaining consistency between the system's design and its implementation during the development process.

Providing a robust foundation for development, class diagrams enable developers to use them as a reference when writing code, ensuring that the system's structure aligns with the initial design. They also promote code reuse by identifying relationships between classes, allowing well-designed classes to be reused in other parts of the system or even in different projects.

By easily identifying various relationships such as inheritance, association, composition, and aggregation, class diagrams help developers understand how different parts of the system interact. They facilitate static analysis, emphasizing the structure without delving into dynamic behavior, which proves particularly beneficial in the initial design phase of the project.

Moreover, class diagrams contribute to the ease of maintenance by providing a clear view of the system's structure. Necessary changes can be identified more efficiently, reducing errors and maintenance costs. In summary, class diagrams are powerful tools for designing and communicating the static structure of an object-oriented system, offering numerous advantages throughout the software development lifecycle.

### 3. Sequence diagrams

Using sequence diagrams is crucial to ensure a clear understanding of our project and system. They provide a dynamic visual representation of interactions between objects in a system over time. Detailing the sequence of events between objects, illustrating how they collaborate to accomplish specific functionalities, these diagrams offer a clear abstraction by highlighting message exchanges between objects, simplifying the understanding of the system's operational logic.

As a communication tool, they facilitate the understanding of execution flows between objects for development team members. Serving as a robust foundation for development, these diagrams provide a visual representation of dynamic interactions, guiding implementation and ensuring consistency with the design.

Focused on the chronology of events, they assist in anticipating and comprehending the system's behavior in various usage scenarios. Ultimately, sequence diagrams are adaptable to changes, allowing for updates to the representation based on the evolving needs of the system throughout the development cycle.
